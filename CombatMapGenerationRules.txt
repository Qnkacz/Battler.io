1. Map should fit the screen
    1.1 One approach: Generate Depending on the Screen ratio
    1.2 2nd approach: Generate one size and scale it

2. Map Should have different variants depending on the outside biome
    2.1 Different ground texture depending on the biome
    2.2 Map should have small obstacles depending on biome
        2.2a: Small obstacles are for example:
        -bushes
        -rocks
        -trees
        -trunks
    2.3 Map should have different big obstacles depending on the outside biome
        2.3a:
        -If the Combat is near a river, then the map should have a flowing river
        -if the combat is on a castle, then the map should have walls
        -etc etc
        2.3b:
        Big obstacles can cut the map in a shape or form
        In the future the should be a mechanic that allows of crossing a big obstacle (for example building/summoning a bridge on a river obstacle)
3. Map should have a generated navmesh that considers obstacles
4. On the "preparation faze" of the combat a player should be able to make spawners only on his half of the map
